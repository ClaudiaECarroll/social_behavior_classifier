       " 'She questioned him immensely about England, about the British constitution, the English character, the state of politics, the manners and customs of the royal family, the peculiarities of the aristocracy, the way of living and thinking of his neighbours; and in begging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether they corresponded with the descriptions in the books.',\n",

       " 'He sat down on a bench, unceremoniously, doggedly, like a man in trouble; leaning his elbows on his knees and staring at the floor.',\n",
       " 'The party went more than once to the British Museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims for antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb; they spent a morning in the Abbey and went on a penny-steamer to the Tower; they looked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat on various occasions beneath the great trees in Kensington Gardens.',\n",

       " 'He leaned forward, a hand on each knee; for some moments he bent his eyes on the floor.',\n",
       " 'In her infantine excursions to Europe she had seen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window; Paris, not London, was her father’s Mecca, and into many of his interests there his children had naturally not entered.',\n",

       " 'At moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong, and then she treated herself to a week of passionate humility.',\n",
       " 'After this she held her head higher than ever again; for it was of no use, she had an unquenchable desire to think well of herself.',\n",
       " 'She had a theory that it was only under this provision life was worth living; that one should be one of the best, should be conscious of a fine organisation (she couldn’t help knowing her organisation was fine), should move in a realm of light, of natural wisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully chronic.',\n",
       " 'The girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered her a good many services and played her a great many tricks.',\n",

       " 'She had an infinite hope that she should never do anything wrong.',\n",
       " 'She had resented so strongly, after discovering them, her mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as if she had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered her) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another person, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to hold her breath.',\n",

       " 'She was always planning out her development, desiring her perfection, observing her progress.',\n",
       " 'In the current of that repaid curiosity on which she had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this beautiful old England and might carry her much further still, she often checked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were less happy than herself—a thought which for the moment made her fine, full consciousness appear a kind of immodesty.',\n",
       " 'She was too young, too impatient to live, too unacquainted with pain.',\n",

       " 'It suddenly came upon her that her situation was one which a few weeks ago she would have deemed deeply romantic: the park of an old English country-house, with the foreground embellished by a “great” (as she supposed) nobleman in the act of making love to a young lady who, on careful inspection, should be found to present remarkable analogies with herself.',\n",
       " 'He cared no more for them than for the rosebud in his buttonhole.',\n",

       " 'She had taken more satisfaction in Isabel’s accession of fortune than if the money had been left to herself; it had seemed to her to offer just the proper setting for her sister’s slightly meagre, but scarce the less eminent figure.',\n",
       " 'She considered, with the presumption of youth, that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it; and this conviction was an aid to detecting an occasional flash of cruelty, an occasional lapse from candour, in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception.',\n",
       " 'As she reflected a good deal she had allowed him a certain amount of compassion; but she always had a dread of wasting that essence—a precious article, worth more to the giver than to any one else.',\n",

       " 'Madame Merle instantly became conscious that she had spoken more quickly than usual, and the reflection brought the colour to her cheek.',\n",
       " 'After he had gone she wondered if she had prevented something which would have happened if she had absented herself for a quarter of an hour; and then she pronounced—always mentally—that when their distinguished visitor should wish her to go away he would easily find means to let her know it.',\n",

       " 'She was morally certain now that this feeling of hatred, which at first had been a refuge and a refreshment, had become the occupation and comfort of his life.',\n",
       " 'She made Isabel feel old; it seemed so long since she had been in a flutter about a ball.',\n",
       " 'It struck her as a great incongruity; neither Pansy’s small fascinations, nor his own kindness, his good-nature, not even his need for amusement, which was extreme and constant, were sufficient to account for it.',\n",

       " 'She went over to the barrel, and shook it viciously, not having anything else at hand to shake.',\n",

       " 'His voice went on and on, rising, falling, then rising again, the guttural many-syllabled Gaelic flowing and flowing like a stream.',\n",
       " 'She hardly looked at him, could not have told afterwards what he had been talking about, or what had passed them by.',\n",
       " 'Once more, therefore, wringing out her petticoat and gathering up her hair, which had got loose in her race, she got under the shelter of a bank and sat down upon a stone, near to where a small stream was bubbling and trickling through a pipe.',\n",
       " 'As she came up to the stranger she gazed at her with a look of dull indifference, either from ill-health or habitual misery; set her pail under the pipe in the bank through which the stream ran, and, when it was filled, turned and went back, staggering under its weight, towards the door of her cabin again.',\n",
       " 'The woman stared a little, but said nothing.',\n",
       " 'A glance showed that he was dead drunk, too drunk to move, though not too drunk, as presently became apparent, to maunder out a string of incoherent abuse, which he directed at his wife without pause, meaning, or intermission, as she moved about the cabin.',\n",
       " 'The woman indifferently drew the child away and sent it to play with the other children in the gutter outside.',\n",

       " 'Yet she did not after this seek him out, or try to make their relations closer in any way.',\n",
       " 'Then he burst into a still louder laugh, a laugh that might have been heard right across the island.',\n",
       " 'She shook from head to foot, and clenched her fists in his face.',\n",
       " 'He stood for a minute or two longer upon the platform, then walked away rather soberly, scratching his chin as he went.',\n",
       " 'A ragged tangle of children followed them, shouting and clamouring for half-pence.',\n",
       " 'She went on accordingly down the path, and, when the contact became imminent, merely stepped a little aside, on to a piece of flat rock beside a stunted thorn-bush, and stood there—her cumbersome burden rising behind her—waiting till the visitors should have passed.',\n",
       " 'One of the two ladies put up an eyeglass to look at her, at the same time touching her friend’s arm so as to call her attention.',\n",
       " 'Telling Honor that she was only going to see that the beasts were all right, and would be back in a minute, she hurried outside, closing the door softly behind her.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly she made a bound forwards; she had crossed the yard; she had seized the trespasser—had clutched him by the back of his neck—and was holding him as a mastiff holds a burglar.',\n",
       " 'An involuntary yell of terror broke from the turf-stealer, and he turned, wriggling like a worm, and struggling vainly to escape from her clutch, a clutch which was for the moment like iron.',\n",
       " 'Still she stood rooted to the same spot, staring at him, not speaking; staring as if he had been his own ghost.',\n",
       " 'She said nothing, but when he had stepped over the mass of branches, and through an outer circumvallation of nettles, and had come up to her, she was trembling violently, and it was silently and still tremblingly that she turned and walked back beside him through the dusk, as they had so often walked before.',\n",
       " 'So they walked on side by side until they had reached the cabin.',\n",
       " 'She stood perfectly still while he capered about the rocks, waving his hands and snapping his fingers as he descanted first on one project then on another.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly she turned, and, leaving him to finish his flights by himself, went in, closing the door behind her; not this time, however, with a bang, but slowly, with a gradual and, as it seemed, a reluctant pressure from within.',\n",
       " 'About five o’clock Molly had to go to see after her chickens, which ‘would be mad,’ she explained, ‘the creatures, with hunger,’ but promised shortly to return.',\n",

       " 'No one came near the door, however, although she could hear someone moving to and fro inside, someone who was evidently quite unaware of that clamorous appeal so close at hand.',\n",
       " 'She stole accordingly to the cow-house like a thief, and, having got down the oars, started again for the landing-place.',\n",
       " 'She looked wildly round, straining her eyes distractedly through the impenetrable, blinding whiteness.',\n",
       " 'She hated Shan with all the hate of her fierce little heart.',\n",

       " 'She knew that she was strong, and took an immense pride in her own strength; moreover, speeches like these were about the nearest approaches to compliments that Murdough ever paid her, and she treasured them accordingly.',\n",
       " 'At this point a mixture of sensations, too complicated to be quite comfortable, came over her, and she left her momentary dreams for the reality, which at least was straightforward enough.',\n",
       " 'That sense of elation with which she had run down over the rocks an hour ago had passed away, and was replaced by a feeling of discomfort quite as frequent with her as the other, especially when she and Murdough had been for some time together.',\n",

       " 'Apparently immediately above them, in reality a little way ahead, one of those same aërial funnels had just opened, and within the comparatively clear space of its air-filled hollow could be seen, not merely the careering particles of fog circling round and round, but something else, something that did not circle or move at all, a few inches of wind-tattered grass, a few inches more of bare splintered rock.',\n",

       " 'One Wednesday afternoon, instead of going to Hector, whom he had told not to expect him, he got a pickaxe and spade, and proceeded to dig in the trodden heap.',\n",
       " 'So he left his pickaxe with one point fast between two stones, and ran to the shop.',\n",
       " 'After they had had their tea, they set to work again, and worked till the twilight grew dark about them—by which time they had got the heap down to what seemed the original level of the floor.',\n",
       " 'He tugged again in reply, and jumped out.',\n",
       " 'They went straight to the scene of their labour.',\n",
       " 'He ran therefore to the house, and brought a rope which he had seen lying about.',\n",
       " 'So saying, he scrambled up the side of the well, and the last of him that appeared, his boots, namely, bore testimony enough to his having reached the water.',\n",
       " 'With the aid of a ladder he put the hook of one of the blocks through the staple, and then fastened the end of his rope to the block.',\n",
       " 'Next he got another bit of rope, and having pulled off his shoes and stockings, and got down into the well, tied it round the largest stone within reach, loosely enough to allow the hook of the second pulley to lay hold of it.',\n",
       " 'He hurried on the remainder of his clothes, and went out.',\n",
       " 'He laid down turf along its banks in some parts, and sowed grass and daisy-seed in others; and when he found a pretty stone or shell, or bit of coloured glass or bright crockery or broken mirror, he would always throw it in, that the water might have the prettier path to run upon.',\n",
       " 'First, he stopped up the outlet through the hedge with stones, and clay, and bits of board; then watched as it spread, until he saw where it would try to escape next, and did the same; and so on, taking care especially to keep it from the house.',\n",
       " 'Willie kept walking round and round it, as if it had been a wild beast trying to get out of its cage, and he had to watch and prevent it at every weak spot; or as if he were a magician, busily sustaining the charm by which he confined the gad-about creature.',\n",
       " 'He dressed in haste, ran out, and found that the thread had got entangled amongst the bushes on its way to the wheel, and had stuck fast; whereupon the wheel had broken it to get loose, and had been spinning round and round all night for nothing, like the useless thing it was before.',\n",
       " 'On the grass, beside the ruins, in the moonlight, by the gurgling water, he told him all about it.',\n",
       " 'While his father was riding across the moor, in the strange hush of the blotted moon, Willie was out in the garden beside his motionless wheel, watching the fell shadow of the earth passing over the blessed face of the moon, and leaving her pure and clear, and nothing the worse.',\n",
       " 'With this he rose and went to his laboratory.',\n",
       " 'He climbed the ladder, pushed open the trap-door, crept half through, and surveyed the gloomy place.',\n",
       " 'At supper he laid his scheme before his father and mother.',\n",
       " 'His father laughed with him, but his mother looked a little shocked.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly he gave a great jump, and clapped his hands so loud that he woke his father.',\n",

       " 'Spelman set to work at once.',\n",
       " 'When it came to the plastering of the walls, Mr Spelman, after giving them full directions, left the two boys to do that between them.',\n",
       " 'Willie took his father by the coat, and led him to a corner, where a hole went right through the wall into another room—if that can be called a room which had neither floor nor ceiling.',\n",
       " 'But all at once she opened her eyes wide, and made a sign to him to come to her.',\n",
       " 'But when they explained to him what earnest meant, then he laughed with understanding, as well as with good will.',\n",
       " 'He had, therefore, a long talk with her about it.',\n",
       " 'First of all he cleared away the floor about the well, and built up the circular wall of it a foot or two higher, with stones picked from those lying about, and with mortar which he made himself.',\n",
       " 'Then he made a strong wooden lid to the mouth of the well, and screwed it down to the wooden blocks he had built in.',\n",
       " 'He pushed the sluice down a little, and waited a moment.',\n",
       " 'Hector laughed.',\n",
       " 'So Hector went on drinking the water and getting a little better.',\n",
       " 'Then he bought a quantity of string, and set his wheel to call him up an hour before sunrise.',\n",

       " 'When they turned again to the kite they could see the golden ball no longer.',\n",
       " 'Willie began to draw in his string and roll it up on its stick, slowly pulling down to the earth the soaring sun-scout he had sent aloft for the news.',\n",

       " 'He spent a couple of hours before breakfast in the study of physiology; after breakfast, another hour or two either in the surgery, or in a part of the ruins which he had roughly fitted up for a laboratory with a bench, a few shelves, and a furnace.',\n",
       " 'Once more she took her thumb from her mouth to give a little scream, and did not put it in again.',\n",
       " 'Long ago, almost the moment he arrived, he had set his wheel in order, and got his waking-machine into working trim.',\n",
       " 'The same night, when his wheel pulled him, he rose and went out into the garden.',\n",
       " 'The very next evening he set to work and spent the whole of that and the following at his bench, planing, and shaping, and generally preparing for a construction, the plan of which was now clear in his head.',\n",
       " 'At length, on the third evening, he carried half a dozen long poles, and wheeled several barrowfuls of short planks, measuring but a few inches over two feet, down to the clump of trees.',\n",
       " 'Then he nailed a bracket to the tree, at the height of an easy step from the ground, and at the same height nailed a piece of wood across between two of the poles.',\n",

       "['That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish.',\n",
       " 'It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest.',\n",
       " 'It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions.',\n",
       " 'At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.\\n',\n",
       " 'But his fear was only momentary.',\n",
       " 'Cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger.',\n",
       " 'But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof.',\n",
       " 'He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.',\n",
       " 'And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart.',\n",
       " 'And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there.',\n",
       " 'His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.',\n",
       " 'And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope.',\n",
       " 'For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will.',\n",
       " 'Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s selfishness, and yet relieved by it.',\n",
       " 'This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed.',\n",
       " 'It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice.',\n",
       " 'It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.',\n",
       " 'It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect.',\n",
       " 'So it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents.',\n",
       " 'A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.\\n',\n",
       " 'He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.',\n",
       " 'He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair.',\n",
       " 'There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.',\n",
       " 'Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror.',\n",
       " 'As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy.',\n",
       " 'Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain.',\n",
       " 'With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was struck afresh by her cousin’s beauty.',\n",
       " 'It was a happy brooding, although tinged with regret at being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin.',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Shaw enjoyed the romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter.',\n",
       " 'She recollected the first tea up there—separate from her father and aunt, who were dining somewhere down below, an infinite depth of stairs; for unless she were up in the sky (the child thought), they must be deep down in the bowels of the earth.',\n",
       " 'Now she had got to love the old nursery, though it was but a dismantled place; and she looked all round with a kind of cat-like regret, at the idea of leaving it for ever in three days.',\n",
       " 'She touched the shawls gently as they hung around her, and took a pleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours, and rather liked to be dressed in such splendour—enjoying it much as a child would do, with a quiet pleased smile on her lips.',\n",
       " 'She had not been quite sure, from her aunt’s rather confused account of his engagements, whether he would come that night; it was almost a surprise to see him; and now she was sure of a pleasant evening.',\n",
       " 'Margaret did not quite like this speech; she winced away from it more, from remembering former occasions on which he had tried to lead her into a discussion (in which he took the complimentary part) about her own character and ways of going on.',\n",
       " 'She really did persuade herself that she was submitting to some hard external necessity; and thus she was able to moan and complain in her soft manner, all the time she was in reality doing just what she liked.',\n",
       " 'Her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty-eight hours.',\n",
       " 'The farewells so hurriedly taken, amongst all the other good-byes, of those she had lived with so long, oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more; it did not signify what those times had been, they were gone never to return.',\n",
       " 'Margaret’s heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it possible in going to her own dear home, the place and the life she had longed for for years—at that time of all times for yearning and longing, just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep.',\n",
       " 'She took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was painfully struck by the worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father’s life, to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.',\n",
       " 'This life—at least these walks—realised all Margaret’s anticipations.',\n",
       " 'She took a pride in her forest.',\n",
       " 'With the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of sight in perceiving that all was not as it should be there.',\n",
       " 'This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what Margaret was unprepared for.',\n",
       " 'Her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all, if need were.',\n",
       " 'Margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown to her mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy.',\n",
       " 'They were a dull list of words, but somehow he liked looking at them.',\n",
       " 'Margaret felt as if a thin cold cloud had come between her and the sun.',\n",
       " 'It was so unusual for the fluent lawyer to hesitate that Margaret looked up at him, in a little state of questioning wonder; but in an instant—from what about him she could not tell—she wished herself back with her mother—her father—anywhere away from him, for she was sure he was going to say something to which she should not know what to reply.',\n",
       " 'In another moment the strong pride that was in her came to conquer her sudden agitation, which she hoped he had not perceived.',\n",
       " 'The whole tone of it annoyed her.',\n",
       " 'She felt a tinge of contempt mingle itself with her pain at having refused him.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Hale was puzzled.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was preparing her mother’s worsted work, and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening, and wishing bed-time were come that she might go over the events of the day again.',\n",
       " 'But nothing to the shock she received from Mr. Hale’s last speech.',\n",
       " 'Margaret liked this smile.',\n",
       " 'Was it to be so sudden then? thought Margaret; and yet perhaps it was as well.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying.',\n",
       " 'She could not help listening, though each new project was a stab to her heart.',\n",
       " 'That morning when she had looked out, her heart had danced at seeing the bright clear lights on the church tower, which foretold a fine and sunny day.',\n",
       " 'This evening—sixteen hours at most had past by—she sat down, too full of sorrow to cry, but with a cold dull pain, which seemed to have pressed the youth and buoyancy out of her heart, never to return.',\n",
       " 'She awoke with a start, unrefreshed, and conscious of some reality worse even than her feverish dreams.',\n",
       " 'It all came back upon her; not merely the sorrow, but the terrible discord in the sorrow.',\n",
       " 'She longed to ask, and yet would not have heard for all the world.',\n",
       " 'The fine crisp morning made her mother feel particularly well and happy at breakfast-time.',\n",
       " 'She could not bear the impending weight on her mind all day long: better get the worst over; the day would be too short to comfort her mother.',\n",
       " 'She felt that it was a great weight suddenly thrown upon her shoulders.',\n",
       " 'The wild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her fancy; she felt inclined to wish them success; she had no fear of them.',\n",
       " 'But to-night she was afraid, she knew not why.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Hale was distressingly perplexed.',\n",
       " 'All these differences struck upon her mind, as she and her mother went out next morning to look for lodgings.',\n",
       " 'There, for the first time for many days, did Margaret feel at rest.',\n",
       " 'There was a dreaminess in the rest, too, which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in.',\n",
       " 'Margaret hoped so too, though she said nothing.',\n",
       " 'She felt no awkwardness; she had too much the habits of society for that.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Thornton was a good deal more surprised and discomfited than she.',\n",
       " 'He had been getting impatient at the loss of his time on a market-day, the moment before she appeared, yet now he calmly took a seat at her bidding.',\n",
       " 'She gave him a low, grave bow when he left, and he felt more awkward and self-conscious in every limb than he had ever done in his life before.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Hale was equally out of spirits, and equally came upon Margaret for sympathy.',\n",
       " 'Margaret’s heart echoed the dreariness of the tone in which this question was put.',\n",
       " 'At night when Margaret realised this, she felt inclined to sit down in a stupor of despair.',\n",
       " 'It was a bitter mortification to her in one sense; but she could bear it patiently, because she knew her father’s purity of purpose, and that strengthened her to endure his errors, grave and serious though in her estimation they were.',\n",
       " 'As she realised what might have been, she grew to be thankful for what was.',\n",
       " 'After a quiet life in a country parsonage for more than twenty years, there was something dazzling to Mr. Hale in the energy which conquered immense difficulties with ease; the power of the machinery of Milton, the power of the men of Milton, impressed him with a sense of grandeur, which he yielded to without caring to inquire into the details of its exercise.',\n",
       " 'It was something of a trial to Margaret to go out by herself in this busy bustling place.',\n",
       " 'But she could have laughed at herself for minding this change, if it had not been accompanied by what was a more serious annoyance.',\n",
       " 'She did not mind meeting any number of girls, loud spoken and boisterous though they might be.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was shocked by his words—shocked but not repelled; rather attracted and interested.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was half amused, half-nettled at this answer.',\n",
       " 'Many a time that morning did Margaret wish Mr. Thornton far enough away.',\n",
       " 'She had planned other employments for herself: a letter to Edith, a good piece of Dante, a visit to the Higginses.',\n",
       " 'But, instead, she ironed away, listening to Dixon’s complaints, and only hoping that by an excess of sympathy she might prevent her from carrying the recital of her sorrows to Mrs. Hale.',\n",
       " 'Every now and then, Margaret had to remind herself of her father’s regard for Mr. Thornton, to subdue the irritation of weariness that was stealing over her, and bringing on one of the bad headaches to which she had lately become liable.',\n",
       " 'He was anxious not to slight his new friend by any disrespectful unpunctuality.',\n",
       " 'Yearning after the lovely haunts she had left far away in Hampshire, with a passionate longing that made her feel her voice would be unsteady and trembling if she spoke.',\n",
       " 'Margaret’s lip curled, but somehow she was compelled to listen; she could no longer abstract herself in her own thoughts.',\n",
       " 'But, in a moment, his straightforward honesty made him feel that his words were but a poor and quibbling answer to what she had said, and, be she as scornful as she liked, it was a duty he owed to himself to explain, as truly as he could, what he did mean.',\n",
       " 'He could best have illustrated what he wanted to say by telling them something of his own life; but was it not too personal a subject to speak about to strangers?',\n",
       " 'Margaret had noticed her mother’s jaded appearance with anxiety for some time past, and this remark of her father’s sent her up to bed with a dim fear lying like a weight on her heart.',\n",
       " 'Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.',\n",
       " 'Margaret could hardly smile at this little joke, so oppressed was she by her visit to the Higginses.',\n",
       " 'They cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her.',\n",
       " 'But her heart gave thanks for him day and night; and she walked proudly among women for his sake.',\n",
       " 'As dinner-giving, and as criticising other people’s dinners, she took satisfaction in it.',\n",
       " 'She liked Mrs. Hale’s double knitting far better; that was sensible of its kind.',\n",
       " 'Margaret was vexed.',\n",
       " 'As she went along the crowded narrow streets, she felt how much of interest they had gained by the simple fact of her having learnt to care for a dweller in them.',\n",
       " 'She saw it in dreams more vivid than life, and as she fell away to slumber at nights her memory wandered in all its pleasant places.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Hale was in exactly that stage of apprehension which, in men of his stamp, takes the shape of wilful blindness.',\n",
       " 'It was a comfort to Margaret about this time, to find that her mother drew more tenderly and intimately towards her than she had ever done since the days of her childhood.',\n",
       " 'To judge by the room Mr. Lewisham thought little of Love but much on Greatness.',\n",
       " 'And not only was the stir of Mother Nature’s awakening in the earth and the air and the trees, but also in Mr. Lewisham’s youthful blood, bidding him rouse himself to live—live in a sense quite other than that the Schema indicated.',\n",
       " 'It made one wonder where she had gone.',\n",
       " 'Its beauty seized upon him, and he forgot to repeat the passage from Henry VIII. that should have occupied him down the street.',\n",
       " 'Instead he was presently thinking of that insubordinate glance from his window and of little chins and nose-tips.',\n",
       " 'An unusual sense of the greyness of a teacher’s life, of the greyness indeed of the life of all studious souls came, and went in his mind.',\n",
       " 'He heard the familiar mingled noises of the playground drifting in to him through the open schoolroom door.\\n',\n",
       " 'He dismissed a suspicion of his motive with perfect success.',\n",
       " 'Unreasonable emotions descended upon Mr. Lewisham—emotions that are unaccountable on the mere hypothesis of a casual meeting.',\n",
       " 'Ludibrium passed out of his universe.',\n",
       " 'He wondered what it might be.',\n",
       " 'He was full of vague, stupid promptings towards an uncalled-for intercourse.',\n",
       " 'He began to expect almost painfully the moment when she would look up, though what there was to expect—!',\n",
       " 'He thought of what she would see when she discovered him, and wondered where the tassel of his cap might be hanging—it sometimes occluded one eye.',\n",
       " 'She had hazel eyes, but Mr. Lewisham, being quite an amateur about eyes, could find no words for them.',\n",
       " 'She knew him perfectly well, which was one reason why she was writing the imposition, but pretending not to know gave her something to say.\\n',\n",
       " 'He obeyed a foolish impulse.',\n",
       " 'The phrase acted like a spur.',\n",
       " 'He was full of self-applause for this scandalous sacrifice of justice.',\n",
       " 'He would have given worlds for something more to say, something witty and original, but nothing came.',\n",
       " 'He took it, searching a void, tumultuous mind in vain.',\n",
       " 'Her hand was cool and soft and firm, the most delightful thing to grasp, and this observation ousted all other things.',\n",
       " 'It was a prominent position, and made him feel painfully conspicuous, except in moods of exceptional vanity, when he used to imagine that all these people were thinking how his forehead and his certificates accorded.',\n",
       " 'He thought a lot in those days of his certificates and forehead, but little of his honest, healthy face beneath it.',\n",
       " 'He felt very awkward, and was for cutting his new acquaintance.',\n",
       " 'He entered church in a mood of black despair.\\n',\n",
       " 'In those days much of Lewisham’s mind was still an unknown land to him.',\n",
       " 'He believed among other things that he was always the same consistent intelligent human being, whereas under certain stimuli he became no longer reasonable and disciplined but a purely imaginative and emotional person.',\n",
       " 'Music, for instance, carried him away, and particularly the effect of many voices in unison whirled him off from almost any state of mind to a fine massive emotionality.',\n",
       " 'Inspired him, if you will, and turned the prose of his life into poetry.',\n",
       " 'So came the great discovery like a flood across his mind, pouring over it with the cadence of the hymn and sending a tide of pink in sympathy across his forehead. ',\n",
       " 'He, Mr. Lewisham, was in Love.',\n",
       " 'He felt a curious mixture of relief and disappointment. ',\n",
       " 'He wanted very urgently to be alone.',\n",
       " 'Then he sighed deeply and returned home in a very glorious mood indeed.',\n",
       " 'He awoke the next morning feeling extremely serious, but not clearly remembering the overnight occurrences.',\n",
       " 'He remembered the thing as a bald discovery, and without a touch of emotion.',\n",
       " 'The proposition jarred with some vague thing in his mind.',\n",
       " 'His whole being was suddenly irradiated with emotion.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Lewisham was glad she loved reading.',\n",
       " 'It was pleasant.',\n",
       " 'Lewisham, whose knowledge of London had been obtained by excursion trips on six or seven isolated days, was much impressed by this.',\n",
       " 'He had half a mind to follow the head-master and ask him if he doubted his word.',\n",
       " 'The tumult of his mind settled at last into angry indignation.',\n",
       " 'And forthwith his mind went off at a tangent to her eyes under the shadow of her hat brim, and had to be lugged back by main force.',\n",
       " 'Shame overtook him. ',\n",
       " 'On Friday his belief in love was warm and living again, and his heart full of remorse for laggard days.',\n",
       " 'It is unaccountable, no doubt, but he felt angry with her as the time crept on.',\n",
       " 'He had never felt quite the same sensation before, a strange excitement, almost like a faint echo of tears.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Lewisham was astonished—overwhelmed almost—by that Reckoning, as it slowly and steadily unfolded itself.',\n",
       " 'The wonderful emotions of Saturday carried him through Sunday, and he made it up with the neglected Schema by assuring it that She was his Inspiration, and that he would work for Her a thousand times better than he could possibly work for himself.',\n",
       " 'He speculated rather anxiously why?',\n",
       " 'Sometimes he had moods of intense regret for the folly of that walk.',\n",
       " 'And then home through the white indistinctness in a state of melancholy that became at last so fine as to be almost pleasurable.',\n",
       " 'He had begun to realise certain aspects of our social order that Whortley did not demonstrate, begun to feel something of the dull stress deepening to absolute wretchedness and pain, which is the colour of so much human life in modern London.',\n",
       " 'One vivid contrast hung in his mind symbolical.',\n",
       " 'His mind was astonishment mingled with annoyance.',\n",
       " 'But he was ashamed of his stupid silence, and irritated by the awkwardness of the situation.',\n",
       " 'Lewisham’s attention followed this slavishly.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly a fit of depression came upon her.',\n",
       " 'She felt alone—absolutely alone—in a void world.',\n",
       " 'And she sat at her typewriter and wished she was dead and wondered what she had done.',\n",
       " 'His logical processes, his emotions and his imagination seemed playing some sort of snatching game with his will.',\n",
       " 'The shadow of that defeat lay across everything, blotted out the light of his pride, shaded his honour, threw everything into a new perspective.',\n",

       " 'That honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses,—the strong, submissive, meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint!',\n",
       " 'Ah, my arms are really benumbed.',\n",
       " 'I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years ago.',\n",
       " 'There were few sounds that roused Maggie when she was dreaming over her book, but Tom’s name served as well as the shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom.',\n",

       " 'Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not being inclined to see after her mother, she compromised the matter by going into a dark corner behind her father’s chair, and nursing her doll, toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom’s absence, neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it that the waxen cheeks had a wasted, unhealthy appearance.',\n",
       " 'Mr Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in a melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.',\n",
       " 'She began to dislike Mr Riley; it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence.',\n",
       " 'Mr Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest, yet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of far-sighted designs.',\n",
       " 'He had no private understanding with the Rev. Walter Stelling; on the contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and his acquirements,—not quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had given to his friend Tulliver. ',\n",
       " 'Moreover, Mr Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in preference; why, then, should he not recommend Stelling?',\n",
       " 'It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go with her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the academy; but the morning was too wet, Mrs Tulliver said, for a little girl to go out in her best bonnet.',\n",
       " 'This attic was Maggie’s favourite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here she fretted out all her ill humours, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her misfortunes.',\n",
       " 'That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a passion that expelled every other form of consciousness,—even the memory of the grievance that had caused it.',\n",
       " 'It was irresistible.',\n",
       " 'Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark eyes flash out with new fire.',\n",
       " 'The resolute din, the unresting motion of the great stones, giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the presence of an uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring, pouring; the fine white powder softening all surfaces, and making the very spidernets look like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of the meal,—all helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from her outside everyday life.',\n",
       " 'The spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her.',\n",
       " 'She wondered if they had any relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their family intercourse,—a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin’s table where the fly was au naturel, and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other’s appearance.',\n",
       " 'But the part of the mill she liked best was the topmost story,—the corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of grain, which she could sit on and slide down continually.',\n",
       " 'That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank.',\n",
       " 'Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and there was another fluttering heart besides Maggie’s when it was late enough for the sound of the gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs Tulliver had a strong feeling, it was fondness for her boy. ',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow morning.',\n",
       " 'Maggie’s heart began to flutter with fear.',\n",
       " 'She dared not tell the sad truth at once, but she walked after Tom in trembling silence as he went out, thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once his sorrow and his anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom’s anger of all things; it was quite a different anger from her own.',\n",
       " 'With this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away from Maggie toward the mill, meaning to greet Luke there, and complain to him of Harry.',\n",
       " 'Maggie stood motionless, except from her sobs, for a minute or two; then she turned round and ran into the house, and up to her attic, where she sat on the floor and laid her head against the worm-eaten shelf, with a crushing sense of misery. ',\n",
       " 'She never thought of beating or grinding her Fetish; she was too miserable to be angry.',\n",
       " 'Maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic, and it must be tea-time, and they were all having their tea, and not thinking of her.',\n",
       " 'Well, then, she would stay up there and starve herself,—hide herself behind the tub, and stay there all night,—and then they would all be frightened, and Tom would be sorry.',\n",
       " 'This resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the tub; but then the need of being loved—the strongest need in poor Maggie’s nature—began to wrestle with her pride, and soon threw it. ',\n",
       " 'Tom had been too much interested in his talk with Luke, in going the round of the premises, walking in and out where he pleased, and whittling sticks without any particular reason,—except that he didn’t whittle sticks at school,—to think of Maggie and the effect his anger had produced on her.',\n",
       " 'Tom was only thirteen, and had no decided views in grammar and arithmetic, regarding them for the most part as open questions, but he was particularly clear and positive on one point,—namely, that he would punish everybody who deserved it. ',\n",
       " 'Why, he wouldn’t have minded being punished himself if he deserved it; but, then, he never did deserve it.',\n",
       " 'But she knew Tom’s step, and her heart began to beat violently with the sudden shock of hope.',\n",
       " 'He knew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what birds were mischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the handles of the gates were to be lifted.',\n",
       " 'Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a silly little thing; all girls were silly,—they couldn’t throw a stone so as to hit anything, couldn’t do anything with a pocket-knife, and were frightened at frogs.',\n",
       " 'Still, he was very fond of his sister, and meant always to take care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her when she did wrong.',\n",
       " 'The sight of the old favourite spot always heightened Tom’s good humour, and he spoke to Maggie in the most amicable whispers, as he opened the precious basket and prepared their tackle.',\n",
       " 'Maggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook, and the large ones to Tom’s.',\n",
       " 'Tom was excited.',\n",
       " 'Maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong, as usual, but presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing on the grass.',\n",
       " 'Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom called her Magsie, and was pleased with her. ',\n",
       " 'There was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened to the light dripping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle rustling, as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also. ',\n",
       " 'Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded.',\n",
       " 'She never knew she had a bite till Tom told her; but she liked fishing very much.',\n",
       " 'It was one of their happy mornings.',\n",
       " 'They trotted along and sat down together, with no thought that life would ever change much for them; they would only get bigger and not go to school, and it would always be like the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of each other.',\n",
       " 'The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown foliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers and the blue-eyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet, what grove of tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petalled blossoms, could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as this home scene?',\n",
       " 'Mrs Tulliver was a mild woman, but even a sheep will face about a little when she has lambs.',\n",
       " 'Few wives were more submissive than Mrs Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations; but she had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable family indeed,—as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the next to it. ',\n",
       " 'And it is remarkable that while no individual Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was satisfied, not only with him or herself, but with the Dodsons collectively.',\n",
       " 'Maggie’s power of sacrifice did not extend so far; indeed, I fear she cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff, than that he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit.',\n",
       " 'He was conscious of having acted very fairly, and thought she ought to have considered this, and made up to him for it.',\n",
       " 'But Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which distinguishes the human being, and places him at a proud distance from the most melancholy chimpanzee, sat still on her bough, and gave herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach.',\n",
       " 'She would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff, and to have saved some of it for Tom.',\n",
       " 'Maggie felt sure that Bob was wicked, without very distinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob’s mother was a dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn’t stop barking; and when Bob’s mother came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them not to be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her heart beat with terror.',\n",
       " 'Maggie thought it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor, and bats in the bedroom; for she had seen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside it, and another time he had a handful of young bats: altogether, he was an irregular character, perhaps even slightly diabolical, judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats; and to crown all, when Tom had Bob for a companion, he didn’t mind about Maggie, and would never let her go with him.',\n",
       " 'It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob’s company.',\n",
       " 'Bob knew, directly he saw a bird’s egg, whether it was a swallow’s, or a tomtit’s, or a yellow-hammer’s; he found out all the wasps’ nests, and could set all sorts of traps; he could climb the trees like a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and stoats; and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty, such as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after the sheep, and killing a cat that was wandering incognito.',\n",
       " 'Well! there was no hope for it; he was gone now, and Maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the hedgerow, and fancy it was all different, refashioning her little world into just what she should like it to be.',\n",
       " 'Yap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his tail in and shrank close to Tom’s leg, who felt a little hurt for him, but had not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for a dog who made so poor a figure.',\n",
       " 'But it produced no effect, except the sense in Bob’s mind that there was a terrible void in his lot, now that knife was gone.',\n",
       " 'The knife would do no good on the ground there; it wouldn’t vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob’s mind compared with the love of a pocket-knife.',\n",

       " 'Maggie and Tom, on their part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not their aunt Glegg.',\n",

       " 'Tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie’s, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something in it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. ',\n",
       " 'As it was, she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn’t mind it.',\n",

       " 'In the society of the duchess, he found all that could sooth his wounded spirit.',\n",
       " 'On the contrary, the system pursued in their education, accustomed them to give way to their violent tempers, without restraint, in their intercourse with each other; and the frequent recurrence of petty quarrels, soon produced sentiments, which bordered on dislike; so that at the moment, when the Duke exulted most in the success of his project, he was painfully undeceived.',\n",
       " 'Happily, a new event which occurred at this time in the family of the Duke of Altamonte, soon turned his thoughts from the failure of his present system of education, the superintendence of which he relinquished with as much readiness, as he had once shewn anxiety to undertake it.',\n",

       " 'She had been hurried on by the evil activity of her own mind, until the habit of crime had overcome every scruple, and rendered her insensible to repentance, and almost to remorse.',\n",
       " 'In this career, she had improved to such a degree her natural talent of dissimulation, that, under its impenetrable veil, she was able to carry on securely her darkest machinations; and her understanding had so adapted itself to her passions, that it was in her power to give, in her own eyes, a character of grandeur, to the vice and malignity, which afforded an inexplicable delight to her depraved imagination.',\n",
       " 'While she was thus indulging her disgraceful inclinations, her heart became attached with all her characteristic violence to Lord Dartford, a young English nobleman, who had accompanied the Countess of Glenarvon to Naples, and who, after passing some months in her society, had already made her the offer of his hand.',\n",
       " 'A deep melancholy preyed upon his spirits; a dark mystery enveloped his fate.',\n",

       " 'She threw up the sash of the window; but the cool air, the distant lashing of the waves, the rising moon and the fine scene before her, had no power to calm, even for one moment, a heart torn by guilt and tortured by self-reproach.',\n",
       " 'But he knew her thoughts: he saw at once through the smiles and assumed manners which blinded others; and at this moment he watched her countenance with malignant delight.',\n",
       " 'It was the face of an Angel, distorted by the passions of a Dæmon; and he liked it not the less for the frailty it betrayed.',\n",
       " 'If the name of love must be given alike to the noblest and most depraved of feelings, the young Viviani loved Lady Margaret with all the fervor of which his perverted heart was capable.',\n",

       " 'Viviani unconscious of her wavering resolution, enjoyed a momentary triumph.',\n",
       " 'But the promised hour of his happiness was delayed; and his passion thus continually fed by hope, and yet disappointed, overcame in his bosom every feeling of humanity, till he no longer cherished a thought that did not tend to facilitate the immediate gratification of his wishes.',\n",
       " 'Yet he, even he, whose life had been one continued course of profligacy, who had misused his superior talents to the perversion of the innocence of others, and the gratification of his own ungoverned passions, shuddered at the thought of the fearful crime which he had engaged himself to commit!',\n",
       " 'His knowledge of human nature, and particularly of the worst part of it, was too profound to depend upon any personal or immediate aid from Lady Margaret: he, therefore, conceived a project which, by any one but himself, would, in every view of it, have been considered as altogether desperate and impracticable.',\n",
       " ' It was, however, a maxim with Viviani, which his practice and experience had justified, that nothing is impossible to a firmly united league of time, money and resolution.',\n",
       " 'Alone, he could have accomplished nothing; but he had a satellite long trained in his service, who possessed every quality which fitted him to assist the designs of such a master.',\n",
       " 'Fearing to utter another word, dreading even the sound of their own voices, after such a disclosure, she soon retired.',\n",
       " 'No—to the tortures of suspense, of dread, of agony unutterable.',\n",
       " 'A thousand times she started from her bed:—she fancied that voices approached the door—that shrieks rent the air; and, if she closed her eyes, visions of murder floated before her distracted mind, and pictured dreams too horrible for words half suffocated by the fever and delirium of her troubled imagination.',\n",
       " 'It was in vain:—and floods of grief, with the sad rites of a pompous funeral, were all which the afflicted Duke and his sorrowing family had to bestow.',\n",
       " 'Heartfelt tears, more honourable to the dead than all the grandeur which his rank demanded, were shed over his untimely grave; while a long mourning and entire seclusion from the world, proved that the sorrow thus felt was not momentary, but lasting as the cause which had occasioned it was great.',\n",
       " 'It was from this cause, that the Duke, more than any one in his family, gave vent to the sorrows of his heart; and murmured at the irrecoverable loss, by which he had been afflicted.',\n",
       " 'Benevolence that never fails, patience under the heaviest calamities, firmness in friendship under every trying change—these are among its characteristic features; and these were all possessed by the Duchess of Altamonte, who seemed to live for no other purpose than to endear herself to those who surrounded her.',\n",
       " 'With this consideration for others, and forgetfulness of self, she had apparently endured the loss of her son with greater fortitude, than had been expected: indeed she sustained it with a degree of firmness which religion alone could have inspired: she murmured not; but submitted to the trial with the meek spirit of pious resignation.',\n",
       " 'But while the soul of the Duchess rose superior to the ills of life, her constitution, weakened by a long period of ill health, and by the agitations of extreme sensibility, was not in a state to resist so great a shock; and though she lingered upwards of a year, the real cause of her death could not be mistaken:—an inward melancholy preyed upon her spirits, which she combated in vain.',\n",
       " 'There is, in every breast, some one affection that predominates over the rest—there is still to all some one object, to which the human heart is rivetted beyond all others:—in Calantha’s bosom, the love of her mother prevailed over every other feeling.',\n",
       " 'Remorse preyed upon her heart, the pride and hardness of which, disdained the humility of acknowledging her offence in the presence of her Creator.',\n",
       " 'The great effort of Lady Margaret was to crush the struggles of passion; and when, at times, the agony of her mind was beyond endurance, she found it some relief to upbraid the wretch who had fulfilled her own guilty wishes.',\n",
       " 'The absence of Viviani filled her with anxiety; and the remembrance of her crimes embittered every hour of her existence.',\n",
       " 'At this moment, even he was touched, as he pressed her to his heart, and remembered her as associated with all the scenes of his happiest days.',\n",
       " 'Yet Calantha’s tears were occasioned solely by the thought of parting from one, who had hitherto dwelt always beneath the same roof with herself; and to whom long habit had accustomed, rather than attached her.',\n",
       " 'The accomplishment of her favourite views being thus disappointed, or at least deferred, Lady Margaret resolved to return to Italy, and there to seek for Viviani.',\n",
       " 'To see Lord Dartford again, to triumph over his falsehood, to win him from an innocent confiding wife, and then betray him at the moment in which he fancied himself secure, this vengeance was yet wanting to satisfy the restless fever of Lady Margaret’s mind; and the contemplation of its accomplishment gave a new object, a new hope to her existence; for Lady Margaret had preferred enduring even the tortures of remorse, to the listless insipidity of stagnant life, where the passions of her heart, were without excitement, and those talents of which she felt the power, useless and obscured. ',\n",
       " 'What indeed would she not have preferred to the society of Mrs. Seymour and her daughters?',\n",
       " 'The Duchess of Altamonte had possessed a mind, as cultivated as her own, and a certain refinement of manner which is sometimes acquired by long intercourse with the most polished societies, but is more frequently the gift of nature, and, if it be not the constant attendant upon nobility of blood, is very rarely found in those who are not distinguished by that adventitious and accidental circumstance.',\n",
       " 'She might be said to delight in prejudice—to enjoy herself in the obscure and narrow prison to which she had voluntarily confined her intellects—to look upon the impenetrable walls around her as bulwarks against the hostile attacks by which so many had been overcome. ',\n",
       " 'By these means, Sophia and Frances were already highly accomplished; their manners were formed; their opinions fixed, and any contradictions of those opinions, instead of raising doubt, or urging to enquiry, only excited in their minds astonishment at the hardihood and contempt for the folly which thus opposed itself to the final determination of the majority, and ventured to disturb the settled empire and hereditary right of their sentiments and manners.',\n",
       " 'Yet, if affection, amounting to idolatry, could in any degree atone for the pain the errors of his child too often occasioned him, that affection was felt by Calantha for her Father.',\n",
       " 'Her feelings indeed swelled with a tide too powerful for the unequal resistance of her understanding:—her motives appeared the very best, but the actions which resulted from them were absurd and exaggerated.',\n",
       " 'Thoughts, swift as lightening, hurried through her brain:—projects, seducing, but visionary crowded upon her view: without a curb she followed the impulse of her feelings; and those feelings varied with every varying interest and impression.',\n",
       " 'She disdained the beaten tract, and she thought that virtue would be for her a safe, a sufficient guide; that noble views, and pure intentions would conduct her in a higher sphere; and that it was left to her to set a bright example of unshaken rectitude, undoubted truth and honourable fame.',\n",
       " 'All that was base or mean, she, from her soul, despised; a fearless spirit raised her, as she fondly imagined, above the vulgar herd; self confident, she scarcely deigned to bow the knee before her God; and man, as she had read of him in history, appeared too weak, too trivial to inspire either alarm or admiration.',\n",
       " 'It was thus, with bright prospects, strong love of virtue, high ideas of honour, that she entered upon life.',\n",
       " 'Yet was Calantha loved—dearly and fondly loved; nor could Mrs. Seymour, though constantly discovering new errors in her favourite, prevent her from being the very idol of her heart.',\n",
       " 'To them, the follies and frailties of others carried with them no excuse, and every course that they themselves did not adopt, was assuredly erroneous.',\n",
       " 'Some favorites she already had:—the Abbess of Glenaa, St. Clara her niece, and above all Alice Mac Allain, a beautiful little girl of whom her mother had been fond, had already deeply interested her affections.',\n",
       " 'In the company of one or other of these, Calantha would pass her mornings; and sometimes would she stand alone upon the summit of the cliff, hour after hour, to behold the immense ocean, watching its waves, as they swelled to the size of mountains, then dashed with impetuous force against the rocks below; or climbing the mountain’s side, and gazing on the lofty summits of Heremon and Inis Tara, lost in idle and visionary thought; but at other times joyous, and without fear, like a fairy riding on a sun beam through the air, chasing the gay images of fancy, she would join in every active amusement and suffer her spirits to lead her into the most extravagant excess.',\n",
       " 'Love, it might be conjectured, would early shew itself in a character such as Calantha’s; and love, with all its ardour and all its wildness, had already subdued her heart.',\n",
       " 'She had looked; she had seen; and what is more, she believed the impression at this time made upon her heart was as durable as it was violent.',\n",
       " 'She herself loved, and, therefore, perceived her cousin’s passion.',\n",
       " 'He had no children; but his nephew, the young Earl of Avondale, was, next to his country, the strongest and dearest interest of his heart.',\n",
       " 'Happily a noble mind and warm uncorrupted heart soon led him from scenes of profligacy to a course of life more manly and useful:—deep anxiety for a bleeding country, and affection for his uncle, restored him to himself.',\n",
       " 'Flattered, perhaps, by the interest shewn him, but reserved and distant to every too apparent mark of it, he viewed the motley groupe before him, as from a superior height, and smiled with something of disdain, at times, as he marked the affectation, the meanness, the conceit and, most of all, the heartlessness and cowardice of many of those around him.',\n",
       " 'To have seen him—to have admired him, was enough for her: she wished not for more than that privilege; she felt that every affection of her heart was engaged, even though those affections were unreturned.',\n",
       " 'He was of a nature not easily to be flattered into admiration of others—not readily attracted, or lightly won; but, once having fixed his affections, he was firm, confiding and incapable of change, through any change of fortune. ',\n",
       " 'He possessed a happy and cheerful disposition,—a frank and winning manner,—and that hilarity of heart and countenance which rendered him the charm and sunshine of every society.',\n",
       " 'Calantha, on the other hand, scarce could overcome her terror and confusion when addressed by those with whom she was little acquainted.',\n",
       " 'Calantha’s mind, he thought, might now receive the impression which should be given it; and while yet free, yet untainted, would it not be happiness to secure her as his own—to mould her according to his fancy—to be her guide and protector through life!',\n",
       " 'Such were his feelings, as he watched her shunning even the eyes of him, whom alone she wished to please:—such were his thoughts, when, flying from the amusements and gaiety natural to her age, she listened with attention, while he read to her, or conquered her fears to enter into conversation with him.',\n",
       " ' It was not perhaps till Lord Avondale felt that he was going to leave Calantha for ever, that he was fully sensible how much, and how entirely his affections were engaged.',\n",
       " 'Lord Avondale thought he had much to say—many things to ask:—he wished to explain the feelings of his heart—to tell Calantha, once at least before he quitted her, how deeply—how dearly he had loved,—how, though unworthy in his own estimation of aspiring to her hand, the remembrance of her should stimulate him to every noble exertion, and raise him to a reputation which, without her influence, he never could attain:—he thought that he could have clasped her to his bosom, and pressed upon her lips the first kiss of love—the dearest, the truest pledge of fondness and devotion.',\n",
       " 'Her look, her manner—all told him too certainly that which overcame his heart with delight.',\n",
       " 'The thought filled him with hope, and rendered him callous to all that might befall him.',\n",
       " 'Lord Avondale was proud even to a fault.',\n",
       " 'He would have said more, but he was too deeply affected to continue:—he could not act, or dissemble:—he felt strongly, and he shewed it.',\n",
       " 'After this conversation, Calantha saw no more of her lover: yet he was very anxious to see her once again, and much and violently agitated before he went. ',\n",
       " 'Lord Avondale had quitted her too, without even bidding her farewell; and her thoughts continually dwelt on this disappointment.',\n",
       " 'It may easily be supposed that Lady Margaret Buchanan and Mrs. Seymour had a most cordial dislike for each other.',\n",
       " 'Enraged at this answer, and sickening at his conceit, Lady Margaret sent immediately to entreat, or rather to command, his return.',\n",
       " 'Buchanan was now daily, nay even hourly expected:—Lady Margaret, awaited him with anxious hope; Calantha with increasing fear.',\n",
       " 'Yet his child’s continued danger turned his thoughts from this, and every other consideration:—he yielded to her wishes:—he could not endure the sight of her misery:—he had from infancy never refused her slightest request:—and could he now, on so momentous an occasion, could he now force her inclinations and constrain her choice.',\n",
       " 'When she saw him, however, her feelings changed.',\n",
       " 'Neither pride, nor monastic vows, nor natural bashfulness, repressed the full flow of her happiness at the moment, when Lord Avondale rushed forward to embrace her, and calling her his own Calantha, mingled his tears with hers.',\n",
       " 'The Duke, greatly affected, looked upon them both.',\n",
       " 'One image had pursued him in every change of situation, since he had parted from Calantha; and though he had scarcely permitted his mind to dwell on hope; yet he felt that, without her, there was no happiness for him on earth; and he thought that once united to her, he was beyond the power of sorrow or misfortune.',\n",
       " 'How then was he astonished, when, as soon as they were alone, she informed him that, although she adored him, she was averse to the fetters he was so eager to impose.',\n",
       " 'Unhappy Avondale!',\n",
       " 'The dread of another separation inspired him with alarm.',\n",
       " 'Agitated—furious—he now combatted every objection, ventured every promise, and loved even with greater fondness from the increasing dread of again losing what he had hoped was already his own.',\n",
       " 'So spoke the man, who, like the girl he addressed, had died sooner than have yielded up his freedom, or his independence to another; who, high and proud, had no conception of even the slightest interference with his conduct or opposition to his wishes; and who at the very moment that in words he yielded up his liberty, sought only the fulfilment of his own desire, and the attainment of an object upon which he had fixed his mind.',\n",
       " 'Lord Avondale thought himself the happiest of men; and Calantha, though miserable at the moment, felt that, on earth, she loved but him.',\n",
       " 'In the presence of her assembled family, they uttered the solemn engagement, which bound them through existence to each other; and though Calantha was deeply affected, she did not regret the sacred promise she had made.',\n",
       " 'In very truth, Sophia loved Lord Avondale.',\n",
       " 'At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life.',\n",
       " 'This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip.',\n",
       " 'And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.',\n",
       " 'The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth tight and nodded.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed.',\n",
       " 'All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street.',\n",
       " 'Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the ground.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration.',\n",

       " 'He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.',\n",
       " 'The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton.',\n",
       " 'The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected.',\n",
       " 'It was enough to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person.',\n",
       " 'The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.',\n",
       " 'In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.',\n",
       " 'They would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.',\n",
       " 'He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.',\n",
       " 'He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.',\n",
       " \"Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine.\",\n",
       " 'The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more.',\n",
       " \"Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.\",\n",
       " 'She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.',\n",
       " \"Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.\",\n",
       " \"Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.\",\n",
       " 'He was silent and grave.',\n",
       " 'His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was particularly gentlemanlike.',\n",
       " 'There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting.',\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.',\n",
       " 'The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.',\n",
       " 'But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled every page.',\n",
       " 'All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.',\n",
       " \"Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;\",\n",
       " \"and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;',\n",
       " \"and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest of the morning.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions for the future;\",\n",
       " \"while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\",\n",
       " 'In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.',\n",
       " 'He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room.',\n",
       " 'Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak.',\n",
       " 'He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.',\n",
       " 'A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.',\n",
       " 'Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.',\n",
       " \"Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.\",\n",
       " 'When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see.',\n",
       " 'Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.',\n",
       " 'But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt was carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.',\n",
       " 'Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.',\n",
       " \"She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might once have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.\",\n",
       " \"To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.\",\n",
       " 'Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.',\n",
       " \"Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which she could wish her not to indulge!\",\n",
       " 'Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen him there.',\n",
       " 'She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks.',\n",
       " 'A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.',\n",
       " 'From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.',\n",
       " 'She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother.',\n",
       " 'But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.',\n",
       " \"Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\",\n",
       " 'Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.',\n",
       " 'Sir John, could not have thought it possible.',\n",
       " \"The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shown in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor.\",\n",
       " \"She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.\",\n",
       " \"The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others.\",\n",
       " \"It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.\",\n",
       " 'Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature.',\n",
       " \"Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.\",\n",
       " \"He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence.\",\n",
       " 'His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.',\n",
       " 'These assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and these gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all.',\n",
       " 'The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to her; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.',\n",
       " \"Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married.\",\n",
       " 'She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.',\n",
       " 'She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.',\n",
       " 'The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.',\n",
       " \"About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\",\n",
       " 'Elinor only was sorry to see them.',\n",
       " 'Their presence always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her still in town.',\n",
       " 'Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.',\n",
       " 'She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.',\n",
       " \"Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.\",\n",
       " 'John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive.',\n",
       " 'Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.',\n",
       " \"After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour.\",\n",
       " \"She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\",\n",
       " \"When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for them.\",\n",
       " 'On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait.',\n",
       " 'All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.',\n",
       " 'He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.',\n",
       " \"Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day, took leave.',\n",
       " 'His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too; \"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\"',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.',\n",
       " \"His manners to them, though calm, were perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be equally civil to him.\",\n",
       " 'After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.',\n",
       " 'The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.',\n",
       " 'As soon as they were out of the house, his enquiries began.',\n",
       " 'Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention.',\n",
       " 'He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect.',\n",
       " 'They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.',\n",
       " 'Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both.',\n",
       " 'Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.',\n",
       " \"Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most charming women in the world!\",\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.',\n",
       " 'There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.',\n",
       " \"The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\",\n",
       " 'The intelligence however, which she would not give, soon flowed from another quarter.',\n",
       " \"Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\",\n",
       " 'Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.',\n",
       " 'Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him.',\n",
       " 'The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house for three months.',\n",
       " 'Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.',\n",
       " 'They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party.',\n",
       " \"The expectation of seeing her, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\",\n",
       " 'The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.',\n",
       " \"So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place.\",\n",
       " \"Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.\",\n",
       " 'On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!she hardly knew how she could bear it!',\n",
       " 'These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.',\n",
       " 'They were relieved however, not by her own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they were together.',\n",
       " 'The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.',\n",
       " \"Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity herto the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\",\n",
       " 'The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.',\n",
       " 'The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.',\n",
       " 'Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as fast as she could, in favour of each.',\n",
       " \"Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\",\n",
       " 'Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.',\n",
       " 'The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited, they were handed round for general inspection.',\n",
       " \"Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.\",\n",
       " \"And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss Morton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"',\n",
       " \"Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his sister's audacity.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.\",\n",
       " \"Marianne's feelings did not stop here.\",\n",
       " 'The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister\\'s chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice, \"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them. Don\\'t let them make you unhappy.\"',\n",
       " \"She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears.\",\n",
       " \"Every body's attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Jennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole shocking affair.',\n",
       " 'In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.',\n",
       " \"Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.',\n",

       " 'He lay very quiet, and listened to the beating of her heart.',\n",
       " 'That sound, light, rapid, persistent, and steady; her very life beating against his cheek, gave him a clear perception of secure ownership, strengthened his belief in his possession of that human being, was like an assurance of the vague felicity of the future.',\n",

       " \"He was broad awake now, with that tingling wakefulness of the tired body which succeeds to the few refreshing seconds of irresistible sleep, and his wide-open eyes looked absently at the doorway of Omar's hut.\",\n",
       " 'The reed walls glistened in the light of the fire, the smoke of which, thin and blue, drifted slanting in a succession of rings and spirals across the doorway, whose empty blackness seemed to him impenetrable and enigmatical like a curtain hiding vast spaces full of unexpected surprises.',\n",
       " 'This was only his fancy, but it was absorbing enough to make him accept the sudden appearance of a head, coming out of the gloom, as part of his idle fantasy or as the beginning of another short dream, of another vagary of his overtired brain.',\n",
       " 'A face with drooping eyelids, old, thin, and yellow, above the scattered white of a long beard that touched the earth.',\n",

       " 'He was astounded at the appearance of that blind head dragging that crippled body behind, without a sound, without a change in the composure of the sightless face, which was plain one second, blurred the next in the play of the light that drew it to itself steadily.',\n",
       " 'A mute face with a kriss between its lips.',\n",
       " 'He was too indolent in the happy languor of the moment to answer the question.',\n",
       " 'It darted through his brain and passed out, leaving him free to listen again to the beating of her heart; to that precious and delicate sound which filled the quiet immensity of the night.',\n",
       " 'Glancing upwards he saw the motionless head of the woman looking down at him in a tender gleam of liquid white between the long eyelashes, whose shadow rested on the soft curve of her cheek; and under the caress of that look, the uneasy wonder and the obscure fear of that apparition, crouching and creeping in turns towards the fire that was its guide, were lost--were drowned in the quietude of all his senses, as pain is drowned in the flood of drowsy serenity that follows upon a dose of opium.',\n",
       " 'He altered the position of his head by ever so little, and now could see easily that apparition which he had seen a minute before and had nearly forgotten already.',\n",
       " 'It had moved closer, gliding and noiseless like the shadow of some nightmare, and now it was there, very near, motionless and still as if listening; one hand and one knee advanced; the neck stretched out and the head turned full towards the fire.',\n",
       " 'He could see the emaciated face, the skin shiny over the prominent bones, the black shadows of the hollow temples and sunken cheeks, and the two patches of blackness over the eyes, over those eyes that were dead and could not see.',\n",
       " 'What was the impulse which drove out this blind cripple into the night to creep and crawl towards that fire?',\n",
       " 'He looked at him, fascinated, but the face, with its shifting lights and shadows, let out nothing, closed and impenetrable like a walled door.',\n",
       " 'Omar raised himself to a kneeling posture and sank on his heels, with his hands hanging down before him.',\n",
       " 'Willems, looking out of his dreamy numbness, could see plainly the kriss between the thin lips, a bar across the face; the handle on one side where the polished wood caught a red gleam from the fire and the thin line of the blade running to a dull black point on the other.',\n",
       " \"He felt an inward shock, which left his body passive in Aissa's embrace, but filled his breast with a tumult of powerless fear; and he perceived suddenly that it was his own death that was groping towards him; that it was the hate of himself and the hate of her love for him which drove this helpless wreck of a once brilliant and resolute pirate, to attempt a desperate deed that would be the glorious and supreme consolation of an unhappy old age.\",\n",
       " 'And while he looked, paralyzed with dread, at the father who had resumed his cautious advance--blind like fate, persistent like destiny--he listened with greedy eagerness to the heart of the daughter beating light, rapid, and steady against his head.',\n",
       " 'He was in the grip of horrible fear; of a fear whose cold hand robs its victim of all will and of all power; of all wish to escape, to resist, or to move; which destroys hope and despair alike, and holds the empty and useless carcass as if in a vise under the coming stroke.',\n",
       " 'It was not the fear of death--he had faced danger before--it was not even the fear of that particular form of death.',\n",
       " 'It was not the fear of the end, for he knew that the end would not come then.',\n",
       " 'A movement, a leap, a shout would save him from the feeble hand of the blind old man, from that hand that even now was, with cautious sweeps along the ground, feeling for his body in the darkness.',\n",
       " 'It was the unreasoning fear of this glimpse into the unknown things, into those motives, impulses, desires he had ignored, but that had lived in the breasts of despised men, close by his side, and were revealed to him for a second, to be hidden again behind the black mists of doubt and deception.',\n",
       " 'It was not death that frightened him: it was the horror of bewildered life where he could understand nothing and nobody round him; where he could guide, control, comprehend nothing and no one--not even himself.',\n",
       " 'He felt a touch on his side.',\n",
       " \"That contact, lighter than the caress of a mother's hand on the cheek of a sleeping child, had for him the force of a crushing blow.\",\n",
       " 'Omar had crept close, and now, kneeling above him, held the kriss in one hand while the other skimmed over his jacket up towards his breast in gentle touches; but the blind face, still turned to the heat of the fire, was set and immovable in its aspect of stony indifference to things it could not hope to see.',\n",
       " \"With an effort Willems took his eyes off the deathlike mask and turned them up to Aissa's head.\",\n",
       " 'She sat motionless as if she had been part of the sleeping earth, then suddenly he saw her big sombre eyes open out wide in a piercing stare and felt the convulsive pressure of her hands pinning his arms along his body.',\n",
       " 'A second dragged itself out, slow and bitter, like a day of mourning; a second full of regret and grief for that faith in her which took its flight from the shattered ruins of his trust.',\n",
       " 'She was holding him!',\n",
       " 'She too!',\n",
       " 'He felt her heart give a great leap, his head slipped down on her knees, he closed his eyes and there was nothing.',\n",
       " 'Nothing!',\n",
       " 'It was as if she had died; as though her heart had leaped out into the night, abandoning him, defenceless and alone, in an empty world.',\n",
       " 'The barbarous politician had forgotten the recent success of his plottings in the melancholy contemplation of a sorrow that made the night blacker, the clammy heat more oppressive, the still air more heavy, the dumb solitude more significant of torment than of peace.',\n",
       " 'He had spent the night before by the side of the dying Omar, and now, after twenty-four hours, his memory persisted in returning to that low and sombre reed hut from which the fierce spirit of the incomparably accomplished pirate took its flight, to learn too late, in a worse world, the error of its earthly ways.',\n",
       " 'The mind of the savage statesman, chastened by bereavement, felt for a moment the weight of his loneliness with keen perception worthy even of a sensibility exasperated by all the refinements of tender sentiment that a glorious civilization brings in its train, among other blessings and virtues, into this excellent world.',\n",
       " 'For the space of about thirty seconds, a half-naked, betel-chewing pessimist stood upon the bank of the tropical river, on the edge of the still and immense forests; a man angry, powerless, empty-handed, with a cry of bitter discontent ready on his lips; a cry that, had it come out, would have rung through the virgin solitudes of the woods, as true, as great, as profound, as any philosophical shriek that ever came from the depths of an easy-chair to disturb the impure wilderness of chimneys and roofs.',\n",
       " 'For half a minute and no more did Babalatchi face the gods in the sublime privilege of his revolt, and then the one-eyed puller of wires became himself again, full of care and wisdom and far-reaching plans, and a victim to the tormenting superstitions of his race.',\n",
       " 'The night, no matter how quiet, is never perfectly silent to attentive ears, and now Babalatchi fancied he could detect in it other noises than those caused by the ripples and eddies of the river.',\n",
       " 'He turned his head sharply to the right and to the left in succession, and then spun round quickly in a startled and watchful manner, as if he had expected to see the blind ghost of his departed leader wandering in the obscurity of the empty courtyard behind his back.',\n",

       " 'He had made up his mind, and the thing was as well as done.',\n",
       " 'In his weary thoughts he had closed this fatal, inexplicable, and horrible episode in his life.',\n",

       " \"Suffolk House, as Brandon's palace was denominated, was subsequently converted into a mint by his royal brother-in-law, Henry the Eighth; and, after its demolition, and the removal of the place of coinage to the Tower, the name was still continued to the district in which it had been situated.\",\n",

       " 'On the groundfloor the shutters were closed, or, to speak more correctly, altogether nailed up, and presented a very singular appearance, being patched all over with the soles of old shoes, rusty hobnails, and bits of iron hoops, the ingenious device of the former occupant of the apartment, Paul Groves, the cobbler, to whom we have before alluded.',\n",
       " 'In a fit of despondency, superinduced by drunkenness, he made away with himself; and when the body was discovered, after a lapse of some months, such was the impression produced by the spectacle--such the alarm occasioned by the crazy state of the building, and, above all, by the terror inspired by strange and unearthly noises heard during the night, which were, of course, attributed to the spirit of the suicide, that the place speedily enjoyed the reputation of being haunted, and was, consequently, entirely abandoned.',\n",
       " 'In this state Mrs. Sheppard found it; and, as no one opposed her, she at once took up her abode there; nor was she long in discovering that the dreaded sounds proceeded from the nocturnal gambols of a legion of rats.',\n",

       " 'Not a star could be discerned, but, in their stead, streaks of lurid radiance, whence proceeding it was impossible to determine, shot ever and anon athwart the dusky vault, and added to the ominous and threatening appearance of the night.',\n",
       " 'Alarmed by these prognostications of a storm, and feeling too much exhausted from his late severe treatment to proceed further on foot, Wood endeavoured to find a tavern where he might warm and otherwise refresh himself.',\n",
       " 'With this view he struck off into a narrow street on the left, and soon entered a small alehouse, over the door of which hung the sign of the \"Welsh Trumpeter.\"',\n",

       " \"Owing to this circumstance, Mr. Wood's boat, impelled alike by oar and tide, shot past the mark at which it aimed; and before it could be again brought about, the struggle had terminated.\",\n",

       " 'During the foregoing occurrences a dead calm prevailed.',\n",
       " 'But as Rowland sprang to the helm, and gave the signal for pursuit, a roar like a volley of ordnance was heard aloft, and the wind again burst its bondage.',\n",
       " 'A moment before, the surface of the stream was black as ink.',\n",
       " 'It was now whitening, hissing, and seething like an enormous cauldron.',\n",
       " 'The blast once more swept over the agitated river: whirled off the sheets of foam, scattered them far and wide in rain-drops, and left the raging torrent blacker than before.',\n",

       " 'Destruction everywhere marked its course.',\n",
       " 'Steeples toppled, and towers reeled beneath its fury.',\n",
       " 'Trees were torn up by the roots; many houses were levelled to the ground; others were unroofed; the leads on the churches were ripped off, and \"shrivelled up like scrolls of parchment.\"',\n",
       " 'Nothing on land or water was spared by the remorseless gale.',\n",
       " 'Most of the vessels lying in the river were driven from their moorings, dashed tumultuously against each other, or blown ashore.',\n",

       " 'Men fled from their tottering habitations, and returned to them scared by greater dangers.',\n",
       " 'The end of the world seemed at hand.',\n",
       " 'At this time of universal havoc and despair,--when all London quaked at the voice of the storm,--the carpenter, who was exposed to its utmost fury, fared better than might have been anticipated.',\n",
       " 'The boat in which he rode was not overset.',\n",
       " 'Fortunately, her course had been shifted immediately after the rescue of the child; and, in consequence of this movement, she received the first shock of the hurricane, which blew from the southwest, upon her stern.',\n",
       " 'Her head dipped deeply into the current, and she narrowly escaped being swamped.',\n",
       " 'Righting, however, instantly afterwards, she scudded with the greatest rapidity over the boiling waves, to whose mercy she was now entirely abandoned.',\n",
       " 'On this fresh outburst of the storm, Wood threw himself instinctively into the bottom of the boat, and clasping the little orphan to his breast, endeavoured to prepare himself to meet his fate.',\n",
       " \"While he was thus occupied, he felt a rough grasp upon his arm, and presently afterwards Ben's lips approached close to his ear.\",\n",
       " 'The waterman sheltered his mouth with his hand while he spoke, or his voice would have been carried away by the violence of the blast.',\n",
       " 'London, at the period of this history, boasted only a single bridge.',\n",
       " 'But that bridge was more remarkable than any the metropolis now possesses.',\n",
       " 'Covered with houses, from one end to the other, this reverend and picturesque structure presented the appearance of a street across the Thames.',\n",
       " 'It was as if Grace-church Street, with all its shops, its magazines, and ceaseless throng of passengers, were stretched from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore.',\n",
       " 'The houses were older, the shops gloomier, and the thoroughfare narrower, it is true; but the bustle, the crowd, the street-like air was the same.',\n",
       " 'Then the bridge had arched gateways, bristling with spikes, and garnished (as all ancient gateways ought to be) with the heads of traitors.',\n",
       " 'In olden days it boasted a chapel, dedicated to Saint Thomas; beneath which there was a crypt curiously constructed amid the arches, where \"was sepultured Peter the Chaplain of Colechurch, who began the Stone Bridge at London:\" and it still boasted an edifice (though now in rather a tumbledown condition) which had once vied with a palace,--we mean Nonesuch House.',\n",
       " 'The other buildings stood close together in rows; and so valuable was every inch of room accounted, that, in many cases, cellars, and even habitable apartments, were constructed in the solid masonry of the piers.',\n",
       " 'Old London Bridge (the grandsire of the present erection) was supported on nineteen arches, each of which Would a Rialto make for depth and height!',\n",
       " 'The arches stood upon enormous piers; the piers on starlings, or jetties, built far out into the river to break the force of the tide.',\n",
       " \"Roused by Ben's warning, the carpenter looked up and could just perceive the dusky outline of the bridge looming through the darkness, and rendered indistinctly visible by the many lights that twinkled from the windows of the lofty houses.\",\n",
       " 'As he gazed at these lights, they suddenly seemed to disappear, and a tremendous shock was felt throughout the frame of the boat.',\n",
       " 'Wood started to his feet.',\n",
       " 'He found that the skiff had been dashed against one of the buttresses of the bridge.',\n",
       " '\"Jump!\" cried Ben, in a voice of thunder.',\n",
       " 'Wood obeyed.',\n",
       " 'His fears supplied him with unwonted vigour.',\n",
       " 'Though the starling was more than two feet above the level of the water, he alighted with his little charge--which he had never for an instant quitted--in safety upon it.',\n",
       " 'Poor Ben was not so fortunate.',\n",
       " 'Just as he was preparing to follow, the wherry containing Rowland and his men, which had drifted in their wake, was dashed against his boat.',\n",
       " 'The violence of the collision nearly threw him backwards, and caused him to swerve as he sprang.',\n",
       " 'His foot touched the rounded edge of the starling, and glanced off, precipitating him into the water.',\n",
       " 'As he fell, he caught at the projecting masonry.',\n",
       " 'But the stone was slippery; and the tide, which here began to feel the influence of the fall, was running with frightful velocity.',\n",
       " 'He could not make good his hold.',\n",
       " 'But, uttering a loud cry, he was swept away by the headlong torrent.',\n",

       " 'Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.',\n",

       " 'She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks.',\n",
       " 'A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.',\n",
       " 'From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.',\n",
       " 'She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother.',\n",
       " 'But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.',\n",
       " \"Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\",\n",
       " 'Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.',\n",
       " 'Sir John, could not have thought it possible.',\n",
       " \"The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shown in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor.\",\n",
       " \"She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.\",\n",
       " \"The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others.\",\n",
       " \"It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.\",\n",
       " 'Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature.',\n",
       " \"Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.\",\n",
       " \"He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence.\",\n",
       " 'His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.',\n",
       " 'These assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and these gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all.',\n",
       " 'The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to her; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.',\n",
       " \"Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married.\",\n",
       " 'She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.',\n",
       " 'She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.',\n",
       " 'The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.',\n",
       " \"About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\",\n",
       " 'Elinor only was sorry to see them.',\n",
       " 'Their presence always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her still in town.',\n",
       " 'Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.',\n",
       " 'She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.',\n",
       " \"Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.\",\n",
       " 'John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive.',\n",
       " 'Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.',\n",
       " \"After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour.\",\n",
       " \"She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\",\n",
       " \"When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for them.\",\n",
       " 'On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait.',\n",
       " 'All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.',\n",
       " 'He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.',\n",
       " \"Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day, took leave.',\n",
       " 'His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too; \"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\"',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.',\n",
       " \"His manners to them, though calm, were perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be equally civil to him.\",\n",
       " 'After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.',\n",
       " 'The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.',\n",
       " 'As soon as they were out of the house, his enquiries began.',\n",
       " 'Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention.',\n",
       " 'He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect.',\n",
       " 'They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.',\n",
       " 'Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both.',\n",
       " 'Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.',\n",
       " \"Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most charming women in the world!\",\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.',\n",
       " 'There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.',\n",
       " \"The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\",\n",
       " 'The intelligence however, which she would not give, soon flowed from another quarter.',\n",
       " \"Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\",\n",
       " 'Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.',\n",
       " 'Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him.',\n",
       " 'The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house for three months.',\n",
       " 'Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.',\n",
       " 'They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party.',\n",
       " \"The expectation of seeing her, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\",\n",
       " 'The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.',\n",
       " \"So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place.\",\n",
       " \"Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.\",\n",
       " 'On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!she hardly knew how she could bear it!',\n",
       " 'These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.',\n",
       " 'They were relieved however, not by her own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they were together.',\n",
       " 'The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.',\n",
       " \"Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity herto the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\",\n",
       " 'The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.',\n",
       " 'The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.',\n",
       " 'Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as fast as she could, in favour of each.',\n",
       " \"Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\",\n",
       " 'Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.',\n",
       " 'The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited, they were handed round for general inspection.',\n",
       " \"Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.\",\n",
       " \"And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss Morton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"',\n",
       " \"Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his sister's audacity.\",\n",
       " \"Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.\",\n",
       " \"Marianne's feelings did not stop here.\",\n",
       " 'The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister\\'s chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice, \"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them. Don\\'t let them make you unhappy.\"',\n",
       " \"She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears.\",\n",
       " \"Every body's attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Jennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole shocking affair.',\n",
       " 'In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.',\n",
       " \"Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.',\n",
       " 'She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise free;',\n",
       " \"and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.\",\n",
       " \"Or at least, if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she ought to have rejoiced.\",\n",
       " \"She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was not Elinor, appear a compliment to herselfor to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because her real situation was unknown.\",\n",
       " \"But that it was so, had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\",\n",
       " 'The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.',\n",
       " 'It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that it was so.',\n",
       " 'They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to advance farther into it.',\n",
       " 'The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen on them.',\n",
       " 'They were not only all three together, but were together without the relief of any other person.',\n",
       " 'The ladies recovered themselves first.',\n",
       " \"It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward, and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.\",\n",
       " 'She could therefore only look her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.',\n",
       " \"But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still improved them.\",\n",
       " 'She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.',\n",
       " 'She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.',\n",
       " \"Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.\",\n",
       " \"Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word; and almost every thing that was said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health, their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about, but never did.\",\n",
       " 'Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and that in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.',\n",
       " \"When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately.\",\n",
       " 'Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.',\n",
       " 'She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.',\n",
       " 'The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.',\n",
       " 'She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was obliged to submit to it.',\n",
       " \"All that she could hope, was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meetingand this she had every reason to expect.\",\n",
       " 'Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before.',\n",
       " \"This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;\",\n",
       " \"and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.\",\n",
       " 'Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.',\n",
       " 'They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on their ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.',\n",
       " \"Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\",\n",
       " 'Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but that did not signify.',\n",
       " 'It was censure in common use, and easily given.',\n",
       " 'Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.',\n",
       " 'It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.',\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would despise her for offering.',\n",
       " 'Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely.',\n",
       " 'Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.',\n",
       " 'But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in the latter.',\n",
       " 'An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend.',\n",
       " 'Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!',\n",
       " 'But so little were they, any more than the others, inclined to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.',\n",
       " 'All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.',\n",
       " \"She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\",\n",
       " 'One thing did disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world.',\n",

       " 'The light within trickled through the cracks of the badly joined walls of the house, and in the illuminated doorway appeared the moving form of Aissa.',\n",
       " 'She also passed into the night outside and disappeared from view.',\n",
       " 'Babalatchi wondered where she had got to, and for the moment forgot the approach of Willems.',\n",
       " 'The voice of the white man speaking roughly above his head made him jump to his feet as if impelled upwards by a powerful spring.',\n",
       " 'He lay very quiet, and listened to the beating of her heart.',\n",
       " 'That sound, light, rapid, persistent, and steady; her very life beating against his cheek, gave him a clear perception of secure ownership, strengthened his belief in his possession of that human being, was like an assurance of the vague felicity of the future.',\n",
       " 'There were no regrets, no doubts, no hesitation now.',\n",
       " 'Had there ever been?',\n",

       " 'All the anguish, suffering, strife of the past days; the humiliation and anger of his downfall; all that was an infamous nightmare, a thing born in sleep to be forgotten and leave no trace--and true life was this: this dreamy immobility with his head against her heart that beat so steadily.',\n",
       " \"He was broad awake now, with that tingling wakefulness of the tired body which succeeds to the few refreshing seconds of irresistible sleep, and his wide-open eyes looked absently at the doorway of Omar's hut.\",\n",
       " 'The reed walls glistened in the light of the fire, the smoke of which, thin and blue, drifted slanting in a succession of rings and spirals across the doorway, whose empty blackness seemed to him impenetrable and enigmatical like a curtain hiding vast spaces full of unexpected surprises.',\n",
       " 'This was only his fancy, but it was absorbing enough to make him accept the sudden appearance of a head, coming out of the gloom, as part of his idle fantasy or as the beginning of another short dream, of another vagary of his overtired brain.',\n",
       " 'A face with drooping eyelids, old, thin, and yellow, above the scattered white of a long beard that touched the earth.',\n",
       " 'A head without a body, only a foot above the ground, turning slightly from side to side on the edge of the circle of light as if to catch the radiating heat of the fire on either cheek in succession.',\n",
       " 'He watched it in passive amazement, growing distinct, as if coming nearer to him, and the confused outlines of a body crawling on all fours came out, creeping inch by inch towards the fire, with a silent and all but imperceptible movement.',\n",
       " 'He was astounded at the appearance of that blind head dragging that crippled body behind, without a sound, without a change in the composure of the sightless face, which was plain one second, blurred the next in the play of the light that drew it to itself steadily.',\n",
       " 'A mute face with a kriss between its lips.',\n",
       " 'He was too indolent in the happy languor of the moment to answer the question.',\n",
       " 'It darted through his brain and passed out, leaving him free to listen again to the beating of her heart; to that precious and delicate sound which filled the quiet immensity of the night.',\n",
       " 'Glancing upwards he saw the motionless head of the woman looking down at him in a tender gleam of liquid white between the long eyelashes, whose shadow rested on the soft curve of her cheek; and under the caress of that look, the uneasy wonder and the obscure fear of that apparition, crouching and creeping in turns towards the fire that was its guide, were lost--were drowned in the quietude of all his senses, as pain is drowned in the flood of drowsy serenity that follows upon a dose of opium.',\n",
       " 'He altered the position of his head by ever so little, and now could see easily that apparition which he had seen a minute before and had nearly forgotten already.',\n",
       " 'It had moved closer, gliding and noiseless like the shadow of some nightmare, and now it was there, very near, motionless and still as if listening; one hand and one knee advanced; the neck stretched out and the head turned full towards the fire.',\n",
       " 'He could see the emaciated face, the skin shiny over the prominent bones, the black shadows of the hollow temples and sunken cheeks, and the two patches of blackness over the eyes, over those eyes that were dead and could not see.',\n",
       " 'What was the impulse which drove out this blind cripple into the night to creep and crawl towards that fire?',\n",
       " 'He looked at him, fascinated, but the face, with its shifting lights and shadows, let out nothing, closed and impenetrable like a walled door.',\n",
       " 'Omar raised himself to a kneeling posture and sank on his heels, with his hands hanging down before him.',\n",
       " 'Willems, looking out of his dreamy numbness, could see plainly the kriss between the thin lips, a bar across the face; the handle on one side where the polished wood caught a red gleam from the fire and the thin line of the blade running to a dull black point on the other.',\n",
       " \"He felt an inward shock, which left his body passive in Aissa's embrace, but filled his breast with a tumult of powerless fear; and he perceived suddenly that it was his own death that was groping towards him; that it was the hate of himself and the hate of her love for him which drove this helpless wreck of a once brilliant and resolute pirate, to attempt a desperate deed that would be the glorious and supreme consolation of an unhappy old age.\",\n",
       " 'And while he looked, paralyzed with dread, at the father who had resumed his cautious advance--blind like fate, persistent like destiny--he listened with greedy eagerness to the heart of the daughter beating light, rapid, and steady against his head.',\n",
       " 'He was in the grip of horrible fear; of a fear whose cold hand robs its victim of all will and of all power; of all wish to escape, to resist, or to move; which destroys hope and despair alike, and holds the empty and useless carcass as if in a vise under the coming stroke.',\n",
       " 'It was not the fear of death--he had faced danger before--it was not even the fear of that particular form of death.',\n",
       " 'It was not the fear of the end, for he knew that the end would not come then.',\n",
       " 'A movement, a leap, a shout would save him from the feeble hand of the blind old man, from that hand that even now was, with cautious sweeps along the ground, feeling for his body in the darkness.',\n",
       " 'It was the unreasoning fear of this glimpse into the unknown things, into those motives, impulses, desires he had ignored, but that had lived in the breasts of despised men, close by his side, and were revealed to him for a second, to be hidden again behind the black mists of doubt and deception.',\n",
       " 'It was not death that frightened him: it was the horror of bewildered life where he could understand nothing and nobody round him; where he could guide, control, comprehend nothing and no one--not even himself.',\n",
       " 'He felt a touch on his side.',\n",
       " \"That contact, lighter than the caress of a mother's hand on the cheek of a sleeping child, had for him the force of a crushing blow.\",\n",
       " 'Omar had crept close, and now, kneeling above him, held the kriss in one hand while the other skimmed over his jacket up towards his breast in gentle touches; but the blind face, still turned to the heat of the fire, was set and immovable in its aspect of stony indifference to things it could not hope to see.',\n",
       " \"With an effort Willems took his eyes off the deathlike mask and turned them up to Aissa's head.\",\n",
       " 'She sat motionless as if she had been part of the sleeping earth, then suddenly he saw her big sombre eyes open out wide in a piercing stare and felt the convulsive pressure of her hands pinning his arms along his body.',\n",
       " 'A second dragged itself out, slow and bitter, like a day of mourning; a second full of regret and grief for that faith in her which took its flight from the shattered ruins of his trust.',\n",
       " 'She was holding him!',\n",
       " 'She too!',\n",
       " 'He felt her heart give a great leap, his head slipped down on her knees, he closed his eyes and there was nothing.',\n",
       " 'Nothing!',\n",
       " 'It was as if she had died; as though her heart had leaped out into the night, abandoning him, defenceless and alone, in an empty world.',\n",
       " 'The barbarous politician had forgotten the recent success of his plottings in the melancholy contemplation of a sorrow that made the night blacker, the clammy heat more oppressive, the still air more heavy, the dumb solitude more significant of torment than of peace.',\n",
       " 'He had spent the night before by the side of the dying Omar, and now, after twenty-four hours, his memory persisted in returning to that low and sombre reed hut from which the fierce spirit of the incomparably accomplished pirate took its flight, to learn too late, in a worse world, the error of its earthly ways.',\n",
       " 'The mind of the savage statesman, chastened by bereavement, felt for a moment the weight of his loneliness with keen perception worthy even of a sensibility exasperated by all the refinements of tender sentiment that a glorious civilization brings in its train, among other blessings and virtues, into this excellent world.',\n",
       " 'For the space of about thirty seconds, a half-naked, betel-chewing pessimist stood upon the bank of the tropical river, on the edge of the still and immense forests; a man angry, powerless, empty-handed, with a cry of bitter discontent ready on his lips; a cry that, had it come out, would have rung through the virgin solitudes of the woods, as true, as great, as profound, as any philosophical shriek that ever came from the depths of an easy-chair to disturb the impure wilderness of chimneys and roofs.',\n",
       " 'For half a minute and no more did Babalatchi face the gods in the sublime privilege of his revolt, and then the one-eyed puller of wires became himself again, full of care and wisdom and far-reaching plans, and a victim to the tormenting superstitions of his race.',\n",
       " 'The night, no matter how quiet, is never perfectly silent to attentive ears, and now Babalatchi fancied he could detect in it other noises than those caused by the ripples and eddies of the river.',\n",
       " 'He turned his head sharply to the right and to the left in succession, and then spun round quickly in a startled and watchful manner, as if he had expected to see the blind ghost of his departed leader wandering in the obscurity of the empty courtyard behind his back.',\n",
       " 'Nothing there.',\n",
       " 'Yet he had heard a noise; a strange noise!',\n",

       " \"Lingard heard Babalatchi's words, but made no movement.\",\n",
       " 'To the old adventurer the idea that fire arms could be dangerous in other hands than his own did not occur readily, and certainly not in connection with Willems.',\n",
       " 'He was so busy with the thoughts about what he considered his own sacred duty, that he could not give any consideration to the probable actions of the man of whom he thought--as one may think of an executed criminal--with wondering indignation tempered by scornful pity.',\n",
       " 'He had made up his mind, and the thing was as well as done.',\n",
       " 'In his weary thoughts he had closed this fatal, inexplicable, and horrible episode in his life.',\n",

       " 'The smooth darkness filling the shutter-hole grew paler and became blotchy with ill-defined shapes, as if a new universe was being evolved out of sombre chaos.',\n",
       " 'Then outlines came out, defining forms without any details, indicating here a tree, there a bush; a black belt of forest far off; the straight lines of a house, the ridge of a high roof near by.',\n",
       " 'Inside the hut, Babalatchi, who lately had been only a persuasive voice, became a human shape leaning its chin imprudently on the muzzle of a gun and rolling an uneasy eye over the reappearing world.',\n",

       " 'It seemed to him that he had never, never in his life, seen Lingard.',\n",
       " 'A fit of coughing checked his sentence in a faint splutter.',\n",
       " 'Directly afterwards he swallowed--as it were--a couple of pebbles, throwing his chin up in the act; and Lingard, who looked at him narrowly, saw a bone, sharp and triangular like the head of a snake, dart up and down twice under the skin of his throat.',\n",
       " 'Then that, too, did not move. Nothing moved.',\n",
       " 'He drew a long breath.',\n",

       " 'He glanced aside, and saw the bosom of the woman near him rise and fall in quick respirations that moved slightly up and down her hand, which was pressed to her breast with all the fingers spread out and a little curved, as if grasping something too big for its span.',\n",
       " 'And nearly a minute passed.',\n",
       " 'One of those minutes when the voice is silenced, while the thoughts flutter in the head, like captive birds inside a cage, in rushes desperate, exhausting and vain.',\n",
       " 'On the night of Friday, the 26th of November, 1703, and at the hour of eleven, the door of a miserable habitation, situated in an obscure quarter of the Borough of Southwark, known as the Old Mint, was opened;',\n",
       " 'and a man, with a lantern in his hand, appeared at the threshold.',\n",
       " 'This person, whose age might be about forty, was attired in a brown double-breasted frieze coat, with very wide skirts, and a very narrow collar; a light drugget waistcoat, with pockets reaching to the knees; black plush breeches; grey worsted hose; and shoes with round toes, wooden heels, and high quarters, fastened by small silver buckles.',\n",
       " 'He wore a three-cornered hat, a sandy-coloured scratch wig, and had a thick woollen wrapper folded round his throat.',\n",
       " 'His clothes had evidently seen some service, and were plentifully begrimed with the dust of the workshop.',\n",
       " 'Still he had a decent look, and decidedly the air of one well-to-do in the world.',\n",
       " 'In stature, he was short and stumpy; in person, corpulent; and in countenance, sleek, snub-nosed, and demure.',\n",
       " 'Immediately behind this individual, came a pale, poverty-stricken woman, whose forlorn aspect contrasted strongly with his plump and comfortable physiognomy.',\n",
       " 'She was dressed in a tattered black stuff gown, discoloured by various stains, and intended, it would seem, from the remnants of rusty crape with which it was here and there tricked out, to represent the garb of widowhood,',\n",

       " 'Checking an ominous cough, that, ever and anon, convulsed her lungs,',\n",
       " 'the poor woman addressed a few parting words to her companion, who lingered at the doorway as if he had something on his mind, which he did not very well know how to communicate.',\n",
       " 'So saying, he re-entered the house, closed the door, and, followed by the widow, proceeded to the fire-place, where a handful of chips, apparently just lighted, crackled within the rusty grate.',\n",
       " 'The room in which this interview took place had a sordid and miserable look.',\n",
       " 'Rotten, and covered with a thick coat of dirt, the boards of the floor presented a very insecure footing; the bare walls were scored all over with grotesque designs, the chief of which represented the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar.',\n",
       " 'The rest were hieroglyphic characters, executed in red chalk and charcoal.',\n",
       " 'The ceiling had, in many places, given way; the laths had been removed; and, where any plaster remained, it was either mapped and blistered with damps, or festooned with dusty cobwebs.',\n",
       " 'Over an old crazy bedstead was thrown a squalid, patchwork counterpane; and upon the counterpane lay a black hood and scarf, a pair of bodice of the cumbrous form in vogue at the beginning of the last century, and some other articles of female attire.',\n",
       " 'On a small shelf near the foot of the bed stood a couple of empty phials, a cracked ewer and basin, a brown jug without a handle, a small tin coffee-pot without a spout, a saucer of rouge, a fragment of looking-glass, and a flask, labelled \"Rosa Solis.\"',\n",
       " 'Broken pipes littered the floor, if that can be said to be littered, which, in the first instance, was a mass of squalor and filth.',\n",

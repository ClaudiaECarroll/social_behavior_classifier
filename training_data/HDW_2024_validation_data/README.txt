This folder contains the data for three fold cross validation for the behavior classifier for the HDW 2024

There are three files:

eric_validation contains the mental, behavior and null sentences labeled by Lucia Pirone and Sada Watanabe, without the labels and scrambled at random. 

lucia_validation contains the mental, behavior and null sentences labeled by Eric Boles and Sada Watanabe, without the labels and scrambled at random.

claudia_validation contains the mental, behavior and null sentences labeled by Eric Boles, Lucia Pirone and Sada Watanabe, without the labels and scrambled at random.

*In this round, ONLY sentences from third person novels were validated, and ONLY the primary designation (behavior, mental, null)*

Additional data (sub-category annotations, sentences and annotations from first person novels, and metadata are available in the HDW_2024_classifier_annotations folder)
